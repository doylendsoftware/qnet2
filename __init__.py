#
# INTERNET IN GENERAL:
#
# Communications over the internet take place between two computers. One pro-
# vides the service (such as a printer, cloud storage, etc). This computer is
# called the 'server'. The other side is the client. A client communicates
# with the server to use the service offered.
#
# One server may have many clients, and a computer can act as a client to many
# servers at the same time.
#
# Servers on the Internet are identified by their IP address. Similar to a
# phone number, an IP address identifies computers. Many servers are also
# identified by a domain name - also called a web address - such as google.com
#
# When you type 'google.com' into your web browser, a service called DNS
# translates that web address into the IP address of the nearest Google
# server. Then your computer - the client - can request the services of the
# Google server: its search engine.
#
# A server has many ports, and each port can provide a different service. For
# example, the GMail server provides a friendly-looking interface on port 80
# (the port for web browsers.) It uses another port to accept connections from
# other email servers delivering mail sent to GMail accounts.
#
# Most low-numbered ports are already assigned specific functions. For
# example, port 80 is ALWAYS the port used for web browsers to connect. If you
# wish to write your own server, make sure to use a high-numbered port (ports
# higher than 4096 usually work well.)
#
# Note that port numbers do not go above 65535 (2^16 - 1).
#
#
# QNET PROTOCOL:
#
# QNet is a very simple way for a server and a client to talk to one another.
# In QNet, communications between the server and the client look like this:
#
#       1) The client sends a string to the server.
#       2) The server responds with another string.
#       3) The conversation is finished.
#
# In order to send more data, the client has to open another conversation.
#
# All QNet servers are expected to support the following requests:
#
#       who:        Respond with the server name.
#       motd:       Respond with the Message Of The Day (MOTD).
#
#
# QNET LIBRARY:
#
# The Connection class creates a connection to a server. You can perform as
# many conversations as you want on the same connection.
#
# The converse() function handles a conversation. It takes one parameter: the
# message you want to send. It returns the server's response.
#
# The QNetServer class creates a QNet server. In order to use it, you simply
# subclass it and override the default functions. See the example programs for
# ways to do this.
#
#
# GENERAL NOTES:
#
# Never, ever, EVER send passwords over the network. It is fairly
# easy to watch someone's network traffic and extract all sorts of data.
# Boil your password down using an irreversable algorithm like SHA-512. For
# more information on doing this, look at Python's built-in hashlib library.
#
# Enjoy!
